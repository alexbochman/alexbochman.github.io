#### Validator Links

<ul>
    <li>  https://validator.w3.org/   </li>
    <li>  https://validator.nu/       </li>
</ul>

> Both of my HTML pages validated on both of the provided HTML validation sites. Validator websites listed above.   <br>
For CSS - The only caveat is that because of the href links, the validators detected an error in my HTML files.     <br>
The error is due to the fact that only the HTML pages are being validated, and without the CSS pages that are       <br>
being referenced, the validators think there's something wrong, but again, there isn't.                             <br>
The error is: unknown error java.lang.Exception: import file://localhost/main.css: Operation not permitted          <br>
CSS validator link below:                                                                                           <br>

### <p align="center">Homework 3 - Styling Homework.html With Pacific.css </p>

<hr>       

> Homework3.html passed both HTML validator websites (previously linked above).             <br>
Homework3.html and pacific.css both passedthe CSS validator (previously linked above).      <br>
The only issues I had with this assignment was trying to figure out how to get the page     <br>
layout such that the navigation bar extends to the bottom of the container while pushing    <br>
the footer to the right. I settled with using grid-areas.
