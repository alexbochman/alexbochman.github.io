> A group project for the Software Engineering I course. The VS-Saturn 3 team is made up of five members who were assigned the task of creating an extension for Visual Studio Code, a free source-code editor. The idea of the extension stems from the [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFW3Ld7JO0w&ab_channel=CirilloCompany) for time management.
